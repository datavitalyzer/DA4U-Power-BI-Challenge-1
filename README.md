# DA4U-Power-BI-Challenges | Candidate Data Analytics

Welcome to the Candidate Data Analytics Challenge!  
This repository is designed to test and sharpen your **data transformation, cleaning, and analysis** skills using **Power BI**.

You’ll work with both **structured** and **unstructured** versions of a dataset containing candidate application records.  
Some files are clean, others contain anomalies — your task is to detect issues, transform the data, and create dashboards that reveal meaningful insights.


## 🎯 Challenge Overview

For this challenge, you’ll:
- 🔍 **Interrogate the data in depth:** Go beyond spotting surface‑level issues — investigate missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formatting, invalid entries, and unusual patterns that might affect interpretation.  
- 🛠️ **Transform and model with purpose:** Normalize, clean, and reshape using Power Query & DAX — ensuring your model supports complex analysis and storytelling.  
- 📊 **Extract and communicate insights:** Build interactive dashboards and a concise analytical report that not only addresses the key analysis areas (temporal, geographic, demographic, etc.) but also uncovers hidden trends, anomalies, and correlations, with clear suggestions for their potential impact.  


## 💡 Tips for Success

- Don’t trust the data — explore it thoroughly  
- Look for anomalies (duplicate IDs, invalid dates, mismatched cities/regions)  
- Use Power Query tools such as **Remove Errors**, **Replace Values**, **Group By**, and **Custom Columns**  
- Think like an analyst — what story is the data trying to tell?  
- Document your process so others can learn from your approach  


## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download the provided datasets from data folder
2. Open **Power BI Desktop**  
3. Load data into **Power Query Editor**  
4. Investigate, clean, and transform data  
5. Create calculated columns and relationships  
6. Build your dashboards for each insight category  
7. Document your findings and submit your `.pbix` file
